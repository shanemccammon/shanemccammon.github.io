            <h3>EDL</h3>
            <p class="button-description">
                In Electronics Design Lab I developed a bluetooth controlled rover with custom PID motor control.
            </p>
            <h3>Application of Embedded Systems</h3>
            <p class="button-description">
                This course explored embedded systems and many potential applications. Below is my final project which was a photoresistive circuit that activates in low-light conditions. This was also my first custome PCB design.
            </p>

            <h3>Embedded AI</h3>
            <p class="button-description">
                An introductory course into applications of AI in embedded systems. We explored building, training, and quantizing various different TensorFLowLite models as well as exploring their structure. The github repo of my projects can be found below:
            </p>

            <h3>Experimental Physics</h3>
            <p class="button-description">
                For this course I had the pleasure of participating in research concerning Coronal Heating of the Sun determined by solar flare frequency and distribution led by Dr. James Paul Mason. A link to the publication is below:
                https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/accc89
            </p>

            <h3>Power Electronics</h3>
            <p class="button-description">
                As the follow up course for Intro to Power Electronics, this lab focused on developing a power conditioning system (buck converter, boost converter and inverter) for an 85W PV Panel. This system also implemented Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) through a microcontroller.
